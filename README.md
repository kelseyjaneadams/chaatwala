Chaatwala is designed for food enthusiasts who enjoy authentic Indian street food and seek a hassle-free booking experience. The target audience includes:
- Users: Initial site visitors exploring the restaurantâ€™s offerings before deciding to register.

## **Data Modeling**

#### **1. Booking**
Model representing a table booking.

| Name              | Database Key     | Field Type    | Validation |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| User            | user           | ForeignKey (User) | on_delete=models.CASCADE |
| Contact Name    | contact_name   | CharField    | max_length=50, blank=False |
| Number of Guests | number_of_guests | IntegerField | choices=GUEST_CHOICES (1-6) |
| Booking Date    | booking_date   | DateField    | Cannot be in the past |
| Booking Time    | booking_time   | TimeField    | Required |
| Special Request | special_request | TextField    | max_length=500, blank=True, null=True |
| Status         | status         | CharField    | choices=STATUS_CHOICES (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled), default="Pending" |

#### **Validation & Business Logic**
- **Past Date Restriction:** `booking_date` cannot be set in the past.
- **Status Reset on Update:** If a confirmed booking is modified (`date/time/guests`), status reverts to **"Pending"**.
- **String Representation:** Displays booking details as `"Booking by {user} for {guests} on {date} at {time}"`.

#### **2. Review**
Model representing user reviews.

| Name         | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| User        | user         | ForeignKey (User) | on_delete=models.CASCADE |
| Rating      | rating       | IntegerField | choices=RATING_CHOICES (1-5) |
| Comment     | comment      | CharField    | max_length=500, blank=False |
| Created On  | created_on   | DateTimeField | auto_now_add=True |
| Status      | status       | CharField    | choices=STATUS_CHOICES (Pending, Approved), default="Pending" |

#### **Validation & Business Logic**
- **Automatic Status Reset:** If an approved review is updated, its status is reset to **"Pending"**.
- **String Representation:** Displays review details as `"Review by {user} with rating {rating}"`.

#### **3. Profile**
Model storing additional user information, such as profile images.

| Name  | Database Key | Field Type      | Validation |
|-------|------------|----------------|------------|
| User  | user      | OneToOneField (User) | on_delete=models.CASCADE |
| Image | image     | CloudinaryField | default="profile_pics/default" |

#### **Validation & Business Logic**
- **One-to-One Relationship:** Each profile is uniquely linked to a single user.
- **Default Profile Image:** If no image is uploaded, a default image (`profile_pics/default`) is used.
- **String Representation:** Displays profile details as `"{user}'s Profile"`.
