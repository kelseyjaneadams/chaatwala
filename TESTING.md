## Bugs

### ð Solved Bugs

### **1ï¸â£ Fix: Manually Creating IDs for Models**
ð¹ **Issue:**  
At the beginning of the project, I attempted to manually assign **ID numbers** for my **Booking** and **Review** models. However, I later realized that **Django automatically handles primary key (ID) generation** for models. My approach was unintentionally overriding Django's built-in behavior. I had to make multiple fixes to the code in the models themselves before realising my simple error.

ð¹ **Cause:**  
Django automatically assigns an **auto-incrementing primary key** (`id`) to each model. Manually specifying IDs caused conflicts with Djangoâs ORM.

ð¹ **Fix:**  
I removed the manual ID assignment from both the **Booking** and **Review** models, allowing Django to manage it automatically. This resolved the issue and ensured smooth model operations.

### **2ï¸â£ Fix: Prevent TypeError in BookingForm**

ð¹ **Issue:**  
A **TypeError** occurred due to incorrect handling of **hour and minute choices** in the **BookingForm**. The choices were improperly defined, leading to list concatenation errors and incorrect form behavior.

ð¹ **Cause:**  
- The **tuple values were not wrapped inside a list**, causing unintended list operations.
- **HOUR_CHOICES** and **MINUTE_CHOICES** were not using **strings**, leading to form validation issues.
- The **default dropdown option** allowed users to submit an empty value, causing validation errors.

ð¹ **Fix:**  
- Wrapped **tuple values inside a list** to ensure correct data structure.
- Converted **HOUR_CHOICES** and **MINUTE_CHOICES** values to **strings** for proper form handling.
- Set a **default placeholder option** in the dropdown, **forcing user selection** and preventing empty submissions.

The BookingForm now properly validates user input and prevents incorrect selections.

### **3ï¸â£ Fix: Booking Form Submission by Adding URL Route**

ð¹ **Issue:**  
The **Booking Form** was failing to submit due to a missing **URL pattern** and an **import error**, preventing form data from being saved to the database.

ð¹ **Cause:**  
- A **missing URL route** for the booking form submission caused a **404 error**.
- A **NameError** occurred due to the **Booking model not being imported** correctly.
- The necessary **import statement for handling form submission** was missing, leading to execution failures.

ð¹ **Fix:**  
- **Added the missing URL pattern** to properly route form submissions.
- **Fixed the NameError** by ensuring the **Booking model is correctly imported**.
- **Imported the required form handling method** to ensure smooth submission.
- **Tested & verified** that form submissions now **save to the database** and trigger a **success message**.

The Booking Form now submits successfully, saving the data and providing user feedback.

### **4ï¸â£ Fix: Default Profile Picture Not Generating from Cloudinary**

ð¹ **Issue:**  
When a new user registered, their **profile picture was not being set to the default image** as expected. Instead, the profile was created **without an image**, causing broken image links.

ð¹ **Cause:**  
- The **Cloudinary default image URL** was not properly set in the **Heroku config vars**, preventing Cloudinary from assigning a fallback image when no profile picture was uploaded.

ð¹ **Fix:**  
- **Updated the Heroku config vars** to include the correct **Cloudinary default image URL**.
- **Verified** that upon profile creation, the default image is now **automatically assigned** if no custom profile picture is uploaded.

New users now have a default profile picture assigned correctly, preventing broken image links.

## Known Bugs

There are no known bugs at present.

## Automated Unit Testing

### Django Unit Testing

I knew from the start that implementing automated testing was important. However, I focused on developing functionality first and left testing until the end. While I didnât encounter many bugs during testing, I still plan to integrate testing alongside development in the future to streamline the process and ensure smoother deployments.

As there are three main apps in this project I will test them seperately. 

## Bookings App

## Profiles App

## ð  Testing & Database Usage  

During testing, the **SQLite database** was used. However, itâs important to note that `db.sqlite3` was **not** used at any point during developmentâPostgreSQL was the primary database from the very beginning.  

Since `db.sqlite3` is strictly for testing purposes, it **does not contain any sensitive information** and is **not used in the production environment**.  

For a structured testing approach, I created a **separate `tests/` folder for each app**, containing:  
- `test_forms.py`  
- `test_models.py`  
- `test_views.py`  
- `test_urls.py`  

Additionally, I tested the **signals** in the **profiles app** by creating `test_signals.py`, ensuring profile instances were correctly generated upon user creation.  

To maintain a clean and organized project structure, I also removed any unnecessary `test.py` files from all apps.  

While developing tests I was running the following command:

```
python manage.py test <name of the app>
```

To create the coverage report, I ran the following command:

```
coverage run --source=<name of the app> manage.py test
```
```
coverage report
```
To see the html version of the report, I ran the following command:

```
coverage html
```
```
    python3 -m http.server
```
The link to the server will appear. Click the link to see the report and find out which parts of code has not been covered in testing.

- No errors or warnings were found when passing through the official [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) validator. This checking was done manually by copying the view page source code (Ctrl+U) and pasting it into the validator.

### CSS Validation:

- [Full CSS Validation Report](documentation/validation/css_validation.png)

- No errors or warnings were found when passing through the official [W3C (Jigsaw)](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri) validator except for the warnings about the use of css root variables and webkits for the box-shadow. However, css code works perfectly on various devices.

### JS Validation:

- [Full JS Validation Report](documentation/validation/js_validation.png)

- No errors or warning messages were found when passing through the official [JSHint](https://www.jshint.com/) validator. However, the validator has pointed out that the module variable is not used, but this variable is needed for automated testing. Needless to say, as the modern js syntax was used (the Optional Chaining method - `?.`) `/* jshint esversion: 11 */` was added to the top of the file.

### Python Validation:

- [Full Python Validation Report](documentation/validation/python_validation.pdf)

- No errors were found when the code was passed through Valentin Bryukhanov's [online validation tool](http://pep8online.com/). According to the reports, the code is [Pep 8-compliant](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This checking was done manually by copying python code and pasting it into the validator.
